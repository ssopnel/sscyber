Hello everyone, my name is Sopnel. I am passionate about a career in Cybersecurity with emphasis on Artifical Intelligence.
Aspiring to be a **Cybersecurity Engineer/ Analyst and other roles in the security field.**

**Skills:**
Java (Beginner), Python(learning), Data Structures and Algorithms, Linux basics, and basics of Computer Networking

I am learning Linux, Python and  Networking because I believe it is essential in understanding the field of Cybersecurity

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, I hope to build more knowledge on fundamentals then use it to apply to hands on labs and experiences. Eventually making projects and joining internships.

In this repo, I am hoping to share the projects I do and guide people along the way so they are able to learn. 

I always look forward to learning new things and having the opportunity to apply my knowledge in the real world and having the opportunity to work with people!
